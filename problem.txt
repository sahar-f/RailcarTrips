Write a Blazor Web Assembly application with the following requirements:

- Create a 'Railcar Trips' page.
- The page has a way to process railcar/equipment events into trips by uploading a file such as the attached: equipment_events.csv. Note: event times are local to the time zone of the corresponding city and are not ordered in the attached file.
- Events should be processed into trips per railcar/equipment and stored in a database where Trip is a parent.
    The logic for processing trips is as follows:
    - Event code W (Released) starts a new trip.
    - Event code Z (Placed) ends a trip.
- Trips should contain fields:  equipment id, origin city id, destination city id, start utc, end utc, and total trip hours (all stored in the database).
The railcar trips page should show the processed trips in a grid (equipment id, origin, destination, start date/time, end date/time, total trip hours).
There should be a way to select a particular trip and see its events in order (bonus / nice to have).
Entity Framework should be used for database access.
Note: the other 2 CSV files can be scripted into the database (don't need a UI to upload or configure).
